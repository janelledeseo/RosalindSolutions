"""
Finding a Motif in DNA
URL: http://rosalind.info/problems/subs/

Given: Two DNA strings s and t (each of length at most 1 kbp).
Return: All locations of t as a substring of s.
"""



"""
Calculating Protein Mass
URL: http://rosalind.info/problems/prtm/

Given: A protein string P of length at most 1000 aa.
Return: The total weight of P. Consult the monoisotopic mass table.

"""
RNA Splicing
URL: http://rosalind.info/problems/splc/

Given: A DNA string s (of length at most 1 kbp) and a collection of substrings of s acting as introns. All strings are given in FASTA format.
Return: A protein string resulting from transcribing and translating the exons of s. (Note: Only one solution will exist for the dataset provided.)

"""
Locating Restriction Sites
URL: http://rosalind.info/problems/revp/

Given: A DNA string of length at most 1 kbp in FASTA format.
Return: The position and length of every reverse palindrome in the string having length between 4 and 12. You may return these pairs in any order.
"""



"""
Transitions and Transversions
URL: http://rosalind.info/problems/tran/

Given: Two DNA strings s1 and s2 of equal length (at most 1 kbp).
Return: The transition/transversion ratio R(s1,s2).
"""



"""
Finding a Shared Motif
URL: http://rosalind.info/problems/lcsm/

Given: A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each in FASTA format.
Return: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple solutions exist, you may return any single solution.)
